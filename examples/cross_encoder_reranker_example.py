    Machine Learning Overview
    
    Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems 
    that can learn from data. There are three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised 
    learning, and reinforcement learning.
    
    Supervised Learning
    In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data. The model makes 
    predictions based on input data and is corrected when predictions are incorrect. Common 
    algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks.
    
    Unsupervised Learning
    Unsupervised learning algorithms work with unlabeled data. They try to find hidden patterns 
    or intrinsic structures in the data. Common techniques include clustering (K-means, 
    hierarchical) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE).
    
    Reinforcement Learning
    In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and 
    receiving rewards or penalties. This approach is used in game playing, robotics, and 
    autonomous systems. Popular algorithms include Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN).
    
    Deep Learning
    Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple 
    layers. It has achieved state-of-the-art results in computer vision, natural language 
    processing, and speech recognition. Architectures include CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers.
